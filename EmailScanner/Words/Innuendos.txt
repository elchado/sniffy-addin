 It's nippy out
 Rubs me the wrong way
 Blown away
 All hands on deck
 Blow your brains out
 Bury the hatchet
 Give me a stiff one
 Chew you out
 Cock and bull story
 Bone to pick
 Brown nose
 Stroking the ego
 Cut the mustard
 Tight end
 Crack down
 Crap shoot
 Deep six (something)
 Bubbie
 It's growing on me
 Gonna pull out
 Draining the pipe
 My hands are tied
 Poking the bear
 Would you like a pearl necklace for your birthday?
 You have a firm grip
 I’m coming soon
 Hard to swallow
 Too many balls in the air
 His left hand doesn’t know what his right hand is doing
 It's a game of inches
 Make out like a bandit
 Milking it for all its worth
 Belle of the ball
 Beat around the bush
 Cleaning the gutters
 Get to the bottom of it
 Give 'em an inch and they’ll take a mile
 Grease a palm
 Between a rock and a hard place
 Tickle your fancy
 Do me a solid
 Eating out
 Blew his wad
 Berk
Nunnery
Occupy
Earnest
Token
Scumbag
Hat
Bread and Butter
Feet
